		<li>The window object methods, when called, can override a program, so this is not good for instances running on a background thread.</li>
		<li>My team and I practiced working with audio elements. I never knew how easy they would be. I expected that it would be harder.</li>
		<li>The data attribute is quite an interesting way to embed private data inside of html. It seems the sole purpose

		<li>The web worker api is pretty cool. You could probably create a stopwatch feature on some web application with it.</li>
