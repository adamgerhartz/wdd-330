	<h1>Notes Week 8</h1>

	<ul>
		<li>This week I learned about CSS animations and transitions. I have found many qoutes in the reading about how JavaScript animations are more extensive to the CPU than CSS animations.</li>
		<li>CSS animations and transforms were never really my favorite thing to do. I know that it makes things nicer, but I just was never into them. However, I loved learned about the different things needed for each transform, and then I loved learning that the <code>transform</code> property is a shorthand for all the others.</li>
		<li>We learned a little about Canvas this week, which is an interesting library that is good for drawing and animating this is an specific area, or canvas. I've learned also that one can use canvas to make video games on a web page.</li>
