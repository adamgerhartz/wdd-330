	<h1>Notes Week 10</h1>

	<ul>
		<li>The first thing I've learned from our reading is that it is a good idea to perform client-side form validation and server-side validation. Client-side validation should not be exhaustive, though. It is good for the user's experience to have some errors caught by the client.</li><br/>
		<li>This might go without saying, but I've learned earlier in my backend class that no data passed from client to server should be trusted. It's important to run security checks and sanitize data on the server side.</li><br/>
		<li>To be honest, I've always despised form-validation in general because I would always customize my form-validation, which was a tedious process that I still don't really enjoy when programming. To learn from our reading that there are built-in options for form-validation and/or other libraries I could use is like music to my ears. I'm not against customization (I often favor customizable code); it's just that I don't have much time to produce school projects that using a library for form validation would be a life saver.</li><br/>
		<li>I've never really liked <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> using JavaScript. I've always felt that <code>jQuery.ajax()</code> was more reliable, in my opinion. I'm interested in starting using the Fetch API to see how it differs. We used the Fetch API in our team activity, and it has been good thus far.</li><br />
		<li>One thing that I've always wanted to know is what keyword actually creates a new thread? I'm a big fan of asynchronous programming, but I feel like I want to build these http requests by memorization and know what is going on.</li><br />
		<li>I like the idea of creating your own Request object to be passed as an argument when calling the <code>fetch()</code> method.</li>
