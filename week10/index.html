	<h1>Notes Week 10</h1>

	<ul>
		<li>The first thing I've learned from our reading is that it is a good idea to perform client-side form validation and server-side validation. Client-side validation should not be exhaustive, though. It is good for the user's experience to have some errors caught by the client.</li><br/>
		<li>This might go without saying, but I've learned earlier in my backend class that no data passed from client to server should be trusted. It's important to run security checks and sanitize data on the server side.</li><br/>
		<li>To be honest, I've always despised form-validation in general because I would always customize my form-validation, which was a tedious process that I still don't really enjoy when programming. To learn from our reading that there are built-in options for form-validation and/or other libraries I could use is like music to my ears. I'm not against customization (I often favor customizable code); it's just that I don't have much time to produce school projects that using a library for form validation would be a life saver.</li>
