	<h1>Notes Week 7</h1>

	<ul>
		<li>This week I learned a great deal about localstorage. I learned that instead of passing individual objects into the database as a json string, I could keep it in an array and pass the array of obbjects into the json string.</li>
		<li>One quesiton I have regarding ajax is whether it is good to use ajax to connect to server to receive a response that something is valid within the database. Or should we use localstorage for things like that? I have used ajax in the past (I like jQuery ajax better than JavaScript, though), and I had to use async awaits to wait for a reponse (a yes or no) from the background thread. The problem with this was that I turned something that was meant to be asynchronous to something that has been synchronous. My undestanding in this is a little fluffy. I feel like ajax is good when you want to display some things to the screen as opposed to waiting for a yes/no response, such as when you check the db to validate a user and password. Multi-threading to me is fascinating, but I have not yet mastered it.</li>
