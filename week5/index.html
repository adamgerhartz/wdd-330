	<h1>Notes Week 5</h1>

	<ul>
		<li>Destructing an array is an interesting concept that allows the programmer to declare individual variables within an array-like syntax. For example, one can declare two numbers like this: <code>const [x, y] = [1, 2];</code>. One can swap values using this destructing-array syntax. <code>[x, y] = [y, x];</code>When I swap values in C++, I need to use another variable called <code>temp</code>, and only then am I able to swap the values. I guess this is a win for the dynmanically typed language JavaScript.</li><br>
		<li>The array in JavaScript is also dynamic. One can insert or delete an item in the middle of the array using the built-in <code>splice()</code> method. In C++, one needs to use a list abstract data type to insert and delete nodes from an list. This makes me question whether the underlying data structure for the JavaScript array is somewhat of a doubly linked-list, where nodes are also underlying it as well. Also, JavaScript can use the <code>push()</code>, <code>pop()</code>, <code>shift()</code>, and <code>unshift()</code>. In C++, one will need to declare a new deque abstract data type to use similar container functionality. JavaScript seems more like a pragmatic programming language, whereas C++ has the access and ability to redefine how the abstract data type is structured underneath the surface.</li>
