		<li>On page 28 of the "Doing Stuff with Web Things," I've noticed that the author says that when I change the <em>color</em> attribute using CSS, I'm only changing the color of the text on that page. One of my questions is: Why doesn't it change the text color of a button within the <em>button</em> tag? I'm guessing there is another attirbute designated to change button-text color?></li>
