	<h1>Notes Week 2</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>On page 28 of the "Doing Stuff with Web Things," I've noticed that the author says that when I change the <em>color</em> attribute using CSS, I'm only changing the color of the text on that page. One of my questions is: Why doesn't it change the text color of a button within the <em>button</em> tag? I'm guessing there is another attirbute designated to change button-text color?></li>
		<li>I've learned that semicolons are not required in ES6, but it is good practice to do so.</li>
		<li>The concat() method is used to concatenate two or more strings together</li>
		<li>Using backticks ``, one is able to put a variable into a string like so: `My name is ${ name }` </li>
		<li>The delete operator will only remove an item from an array, not remove the space allocated in that array. An "undefined" will be put in place of that item</li>
		<li>Use the splice() method to delete and get rid of the space allocated in the array</li>
		<li>Arrow functions are pretty cool</li>
		<li>Initialize with a value is better that just declaring a variable in JavaScript. For example, do "let sum = 0;" instead of "let sum;"</li>
