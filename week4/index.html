		<li>The first thing I've learned is that we should not add any event listeners inside of our HTML file. Instead, to separate concerns, you can do two things: (1) you could add an event listener in between the <code>&ltscript&gt</code> element, or you could create an external file to has the event listener. Either way, the purpose is to separte HTML from JavaScript. This is considered a good practice.</li>
